This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This often happens in functional components before the first render. For example:

```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(count); // Error: count is undefined here if the component is rendering for the first time
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

This code attempts to log the `count` variable inside `useEffect` with an empty dependency array, which runs after the component mounts.  However, at that point `useState` hasn't updated `count` yet.
